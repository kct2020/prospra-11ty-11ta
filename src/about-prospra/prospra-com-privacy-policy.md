<h2 id="status">PROSPRA.com Privacy Policy Status</h2>

This is a first draft of a privacy policy that can be adapted for all my websites. The purpose of this page is to explain common website privacy issues. Then to explain how PROSPRA.com satisfies privacy concerns. Therefore, I will: 
1. Publish this in draft form.
2. Create a PROSPRA project for Privacy Policy creation.
3. Generate a working template and a corresponding policy for this website
4. Create a PROSPRA project for ongoing Privacy Policy maintenance.

<h2 id="intro">PROSPRA.com Privacy</h2>

My view of PROSPRA.com privacy is that I will do all I can to ensure your privacy needs are met. So that means that you must be clear about your needs. And I must be clear about how I meet those needs.

I assume that anyone who is serious about website privacy is browsing using the Brave Browser. So I'll use their features to explain how to ensure that PROSPRA.com meets your privacy standards.

<h2 id="privacy">What is Website Privacy?</h2>

First, there are general website privacy issues that every website needs to address. Then there are your individual views on these issues that set your Website Privacy Standards. So if you don't have your Website Privacy Standards, then website privacy policies are meaningless. Therefore, I'll address the 4 common website privacy concerns<a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>:
<blockquote cite="https://doi.org/10.17705/1jais.00281"><b>Privacy Concerns (PCON): </b>[...]
	1. I am concerned that the information I submit to this website could be misused.
	2. I am concerned that others can find private information about me from this website.
	3. I am concerned about providing personal information to this website, because of what others might do with it.
	4. I am concerned about providing personal information to this website, because it could be used in a way I did not foresee.
</blockquote>

Unfortunately, most privacy policies try to address those concerns through jargon-ridden legalese. At best, this confuses visitors and at worst, it misleads them. So I attempt to explain exactly how I interpret these privacy issues. That way, you might discuss your concerns with your professional legal advisers. So that you can be certain that PROSPRA.com is not tricking you into providing information outside your privacy standards.

<h3 id="submit">Private Information Submission</h3>

Most importantly, I do not ask you to submit any information to PROSPRA.com. However, there is a gray area whereby some technical information might be submitted automatically by your browser. But you are in control of this. So you should consult your legal advisers for personal advice. Because what follows is my interpretation of this technical information. And though I am well-meaning, I have no legal or Internet technology qualifications.

<h3 id="security">Private Information Security</h3>

<h3 id="access">Private Information Access</h3>

<h3 id="usage">Private Information Usage</h3>

<h3 id="summary">Website Privacy Information Summary</h3>

Strictly speaking, PROSPRA.com does not accept any information from visitors. However, I use third party services that can provide me with statistics that help me manage the website. Though these statistics cannot identify any individual, you might not want to contribute your data. So here is a summary of how you can configure your browser to ensure PROSPRA.com meets your Website Privacy Standards.

Referring back to the 4 primary website privacy concerns above, I address these as follows:
1. PROSPRA.com does not store any information from visitors. But it does use third party services which you can turn off in your browser.
2. Because PROSPRA.com does not store information, 

<h2 id="policy">PROSPRA.com Privacy Policy</h2>

My policy for PROSPRA.com is to ensure your privacy needs are met in full.

<h2 id="next">Your PROSPRA.com Privacy Concerns</h2>

You can see that my main concern is to ensure that I resolve all your privacy issues. So I hope my PROSPRA.com Privacy Policy satisfies your privacy needs. But if not, you have to tell me what I need to change.

First, check if anyone else shares your concerns at <a href="https://github.com/kct2020/prospra-11ty-11ta/issues">PROSPRA.com Issues</a>. Or start a new issue if your concerns are not already being discussed. Remember, you are responsible for defining your privacy needs and ensuring those needs are met.
