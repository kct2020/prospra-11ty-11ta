The page you're looking for doesn't currently exist on this website. Perhaps you followed an old or bad link? Anyway, the quick ways out are:
- Perform a <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=2bf1e05c3c5da97fa">PROSPRA search</a>.
- Go to the <a href="/">PROSPRA Home Page</a>.

But I'd like to use this as an opportunity to explain the PROSPRA way to simple problems like this. Because sometimes, what seems like a simple problem, is actually part of a bigger issue.

In PROSPRA terms, you've performed an action (clicked a link to a page). But the result is not what you expected. Because that page doesn't exist. So is it a page that has been archived? Or has someone given you a bad link?

I've found that most PROSPRA projects start this way. Often, an action produces a result that has nothing to do with your expectations. Creating an Unresolved Concern. Then, if there's no simple solution, that unresolved concern can become a PROSPRA project.

Now, our Unresolved Concern is a missing page. So most people won't need a PROSPRA project. Because you can just search for whatever topic or question brought you here. But if that doesn't help you, here is your solution to missing pages. Presented as a PROSPRA project.

Note, this is specifically about finding lost PROSPRA information. But it's easy to adapt this to any website. So this is a tool you can develop and adapt for yourself. Then, you'll always be able to handle "404 Page not found" errors efficiently. I find that a good mindmapping app is the best way for me to record my project notes. But you can scrawl on Post-It notes, or anything else you prefer.

Always remember, there is a logical progression through the PROSPRA steps from 1 through 7. However, it's safe to jump around in almost any order. And you are expected to return to some steps to refine them from time to time.

## Page Lost PROSPRA Project

### 1. Purpose
My Purpose for this page is to help you find your way out. But you can adapt that according to whatever you were hoping to achieve when you clicked on the link to the missing page.

### 2. Requirements
When people visit information pages they are looking for information about a specific topic. Or they want to understand what the website is all about. To understand PROSPRA, you can leave here for the Home Page now.

But if you Required specific information, we need to consider...

### 3. Objectives
So your Objective is to find a specific resource. But is it old or new? Also, you might need information or answers about more than one topic or question. So create a project objective note for every topic and every question. Being sure to indicate if it is a specific PROSPRA page that you need to refer to.

Then, for each Objective, you need a Strategy...

### 4. Strategies
Usually, your best Strategy is to Perform a new search now. So copy the URL of the missing page and paste it into the <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=2bf1e05c3c5da97fa">PROSPRA search engine</a>.

But if you want to read an old page that has been deleted you can browse the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210909060301/https://prospra.com/">PROSPRA archives</a>. Notice that link takes you to the PROSPRA Home Page Archive. But you can also search the archive for that missing URL.

### 5. Perform a <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=2bf1e05c3c5da97fa">PROSPRA Search</a>

### 6. Results 
Results appear after you search. Read any or all of the results that seem relevant to your Objectives.

### 7. Appreciate
Appreciate those results in terms of your Requirement(s). First, follow links to and from results. Next, try variations of your search. But if your strategic searches don't find the page you were looking for, move to an earlier step. That means redefining your Objectives, your Requirements, or even your Purpose.

Sometimes it's hard to see the difference between step 6 and step 7. So think about this:
<blockquote>Say you searched for "can i plan an activity before i do it", you would find the answer is "yes". Then you searched for "can i do an activity before i plan it". And you would find the answer is also "yes". Because those are both true. But you need to gain more experience using PROSPRA if you actually wanted to know when it's best to start with planning or doing activities. Usually, it only depends on your personal preferences.</blockquote>

## Your Missing Page Project
If you still cannot find what you are looking for, go to the <a href="https://github.com/kct2020/prospra-11ty-11ta/issues">PROSPRA.com Issues Page</a>. Then join in with comments if someone has a similar issue. Or start a new issue using the big green `New Issue` button on that issues page.
