Welcome to PROSPRA.

This is a draft version on the development website. Prior to deploying the production version, I will:
- advise you about what to do next on this website.

I've published this website to help you arrange routine activities and small project tasks more efficiently.

<h2 id="history">PROSPRA History</h2>
The best way to see how PROSPRA has developed is to look through the blog articles here. Also look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616012046/http://prospra.com/">PROSPRA.com in The Wayback Machine</a>.

<h2 id="status">PROSPRA Status</h2>
Currently, I am moving PROSPRA.com from WordPress to the Eleventy Jamstack platform.

<h2 id="intent">PROSPRA Intentions</h2>

I intend to continue growing PROSPRA by providing many more examples. Then use those examples to clarify PROSPRA principles and guidelines.

Wait for content, register for notifications, etc. Maybe see social media.
