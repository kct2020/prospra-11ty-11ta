# PROSPRA.com Activities Arranger Website Source

![.github/prospra-screenshot.webp](.github/prospra-screenshot.webp)

Arrange new activities or re-arrange existing routines more efficiently.

This project is built mostly edited with [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

## How to add new project

- Just start a [New Issue](./issues/new/choose)

## Develop

- I anticipate website users will contribute by commenting on, or adding new issues.
- I hope Jamstack and GitHub developers will guide me however they can. Because I have lots to learn about most aspects of using this model as I transmigrate from WordPress.

## Credits

I could not have got this far without the wonderful gift of [Site In A Box (SIAB) from Shane Robinson](https://github.com/11ta/11ta-template).

## ToDo

- Move technical development to a duplicated template repo and refocus this on improving content for PROSPRA.com
